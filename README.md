## Goal

This project is my laboratory and tutorial for phrase. Phrase is an app and api online that make the internalization of an app pretty easy.

The logic is quite simple, you create some localization files on your app, that you can upload to the app where anyone can make the translation. And then, you can pull all the translation into your app.
